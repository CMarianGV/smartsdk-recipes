# Welcome

This site is dedicated to the documentation of the recipes brought by
[SmartSDK](https://www.smartsdk.eu) to launch, test and experiment different
[FIWARE Generic Enablers](https://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers) and combinations of them known as common use cases.

Recipes will be based on [Docker](https://docs.docker.com), [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and maybe some complementary scripts. For simple cases, they will be aimed to run on a single Docker host. For more complex scenarios, they will be aimed to run in a [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/).

Recipes will be organized in folders respecting the FIWARE chapters and generic enablers they are mainly aimed to work with.

## Getting started

Head to [https://github.com/martel-innovate/smartsdk-recipes](https://github.com/martel-innovate/smartsdk-recipes) and follow the instructions to get the code and setup your environment.

Also, have a look at the [tools](./tools/readme.md) section, specially if you want to test the recipes in a local environment or want to contribute.
