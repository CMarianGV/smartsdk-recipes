# Welcome

This site is dedicated to the documentation of the recipes brought by
[SmartSDK](https://www.smartsdk.eu) to launch, test and experiment different
[FIWARE Generic Enablers](https://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers) and combinations of them, usually defined as common use cases.

Recipes will be based on [Docker](https://docs.docker.com), [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and maybe some complementary scripts. For simple cases, they will be aimed to run on a single Docker host. For more complex scenarios, they will be aimed to run in a [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/).

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com) version >= 1.13. Installation instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
