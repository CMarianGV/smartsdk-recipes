# Orion

Here you can find recipes aimed at different usages of the Orion Context Broker. We assume you are already familiar with Orion. If not, refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-orion/blob/master/README.md).

The easiest and simplest way to try Orion is as explained in [Orion's official docker image docs](https://hub.docker.com/r/fiware/orion/) using  [this](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-orion/blob/master/docker/docker-compose.yml) docker-compose file. But here, we will explore more complex configurations for this Generic Enabler.

Instructions on how to prepare your environment to test these recipes are given in [https://github.com/martel-innovate/smartsdk-recipes](https://github.com/martel-innovate/smartsdk-recipes).
